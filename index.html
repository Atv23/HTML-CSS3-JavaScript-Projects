        Sanjay Kumar Sah&#39;s Web Development Projects Repository
      </h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my web development projects repository! Here, you will find a
        collection of projects that I have worked on during my learning journey,
        internships, and job experiences. These projects focus on HTML, CSS3,
        and JavaScript, reflecting my progress and growth in these essential web
        development technologies.
      </p>
      <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I&#39;m Sanjay Kumar Sah, a passionate web developer with a background
        in computer science. I&#39;ve embarked on this project for two primary
        reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Learning Perspective</strong>: These projects serve as a
            record of my continuous learning in web development. They showcase
            my evolving skills and knowledge over time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Strengthening Core Knowledge</strong>: By starting each
            project from scratch and refraining from using copied code, I aim to
            strengthen my core understanding of HTML, CSS3, SCSS, JavaScript,
            and relevant libraries. This practice helps me develop a deep
            comprehension of these technologies.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="project-list">Project List</h2>
      <p>
        You can explore the projects I&#39;ve worked on in this repository. Each
        project is categorized and well-documented. Feel free to browse through
        them, learn from the code, and provide feedback if you have any
        suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that while the projects are intended to showcase my growth,
        they may not represent perfect solutions. I&#39;m continually learning
        and improving, and your insights are valuable to me.
