# Sanjay Kumar Sah's Web Development Projects Repository

Welcome to my web development projects repository! Here, you will find a collection of projects that I have worked on during my learning journey, internships, and job experiences. These projects focus on HTML, CSS3, and JavaScript, reflecting my progress and growth in these essential web development technologies.

## About Me

I'm Sanjay Kumar Sah, a passionate web developer with a background in computer science. I've embarked on this project for two primary reasons:

1. **Learning Perspective**: These projects serve as a record of my continuous learning in web development. They showcase my evolving skills and knowledge over time.

2. **Strengthening Core Knowledge**: By starting each project from scratch and refraining from using copied code, I aim to strengthen my core understanding of HTML, CSS3, SCSS, JavaScript, and relevant libraries. This practice helps me develop a deep comprehension of these technologies.

## Project List

You can explore the projects I've worked on in this repository. Each project is categorized and well-documented. Feel free to browse through them, learn from the code, and provide feedback if you have any suggestions.

Please note that while the projects are intended to showcase my growth, they may not represent perfect solutions. I'm continually learning and improving, and your insights are valuable to me.
